<h3>Why does Portland need another listener-supported radio station?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>3 companies own 75% of our local airwaves. We feel that we have to do something about that. We are working in cooperation with every non-commercial radio station in Portland. Seriously. It's a team effort. The only way to make radio better in Portland is to keep making better radio in Portland.</li>
